description: Fetch and report open and ready tickets from the myStandby Landing Page Trello board. Use this when the user asks for open tickets, ready tickets, or the current backlog for myStandby Landing Page.
---

Report the open cards on the approved **myStandby Landing Page** Trello board,
per the board contract in
[docs/agent-handbook.md](../../../docs/agent-handbook.md).
Trello is authoritative; never read a local backlog or ticket artifacts as a
fallback.

## Prerequisites

Confirm `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`, `TRELLO_API_KEY`, `TRELLO_TOKEN`, `curl`, and `jq`
are available in the environment. If any is missing, stop and report exactly
which one before selecting a ticket — do not guess a board by name and do not
fall back to local files.

## Steps

1. **Fetch board lists and open cards.**
   ```
   GET /1/boards/{TRELLO_BOARD_ID}/lists?cards=open&card_fields=id,name,desc,pos,idList,url&fields=id,name
   ```
   authenticated with `key={TRELLO_API_KEY}&token={TRELLO_TOKEN}`.
2. **Validate board setup.** The board must contain exactly one list each
   named `TBD`, `Open`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`. Fail with a
   clear message if a required list is missing or duplicated, or if any card
   in scope has a duplicate ID. Exclude the `TBD` list entirely from the
   results below — it holds ideas that are not yet ready for implementation,
   the same way a `Templates` list would be excluded.
3. **Derive readiness.** For every card in `Open`, parse its `Dependencies`
   section from `desc`. A card is **ready** only if it is in `Open`, has a
   valid description (user story + acceptance criteria present), and every
   referenced dependency is a card currently in `Done`. `None` counts as
   satisfied. A missing, ambiguous, or malformed dependency makes the card
   **not ready** and should be flagged, not silently skipped.
4. **List results in order.** Report all cards from `Open`, `In Progress`,
   and `Review` (i.e. everything except `TBD` and `Done`), in board-list
   order (`Open` → `In Progress` → `Review`) and each list's Trello `pos`
   order within that list.
5. **Display as a table** with columns: Ticket (title), List, Ready?,
   Dependencies, URL.
6. If no cards are found in `Open`, `In Progress`, or `Review`, report:
   "No open tickets on the myStandby Landing Page Trello board."
